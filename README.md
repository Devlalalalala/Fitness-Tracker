age: The age of the user.
steps: Total number of steps taken by the user.
distance: Distance covered based on the number of steps.
count: A counter for the number of exercises added.

getName(), getAge(), getSteps(), getDistance(): Getters for the user's attributes.
getExercises(): Returns the array of exercises.
addExercise(String exercise): Adds an exercise to the exercises array if there is space.
addSteps(int steps): Adds steps to the total and updates the distance.
updateDistance(): Calculates the distance covered based on steps (assuming 1 step = 0.00078 km).
toString(): Provides a string representation of the User object, including the list of exercises using Arrays.toString().

FitnessTracker Class
The FitnessTracker class manages the user interface and interactions with the User class.

Attributes:

user: An instance of the User class.
scanner: Used for reading user input.
Initializes the scanner and creates a User object by calling initializeUser().

startTracking(): Main loop that displays a menu and handles user choices for adding steps, viewing stats, adding exercises, or exiting.
addSteps(): Prompts the user to enter the number of steps and updates the User object.
viewStats(): Displays the current stats of the user by printing the User object.
addExercise(): Prompts the user to enter exercises and adds them to the User object.
main(String[] args): Creates an instance of FitnessTracker and starts the tracking process.

Summary
This code sets up a console-based fitness tracker application where:

A user can input their name, age, and a maximum number of exercises they want to track.
The application allows adding steps, viewing user stats, and adding exercises.
The User class manages the user's data and the FitnessTracker class handles user interaction and updates.
