The above code is a Python implementation of a Fitness Tracker program. It allows users to track their steps, calculate the distance they've walked, and maintain a list of exercises. Below is a detailed explanation of the code:

1. The User Class
Purpose:
Represents a user in the fitness tracker. It stores their details and tracks fitness-related metrics like steps, distance, and exercises.

Attributes:
name: The user's name.
age: The user's age.
steps: The total number of steps the user has taken.
distance: The distance walked in kilometers (calculated from steps).
exercises: A list of exercises the user adds.
max_exercises: The maximum number of exercises the user can store.
Methods:
__init__(self, name, age, max_exercises):

Initializes the user's details and sets initial values for steps, distance, and exercises.
add_exercise(self, exercise):

Adds an exercise to the user's list if the list is not full. If full, prints an error message.
add_steps(self, steps):

Increases the user's step count by the provided number and updates the distance.
update_distance(self):

Converts the total steps into kilometers (1 step = 0.78 meters).
__str__(self):

Returns a string representation of the user’s details for easy display.
2. The FitnessTracker Class
Purpose:
Handles the interaction with the user. It manages the fitness tracking process, including input handling and menu-driven functionality.

Attributes:
user: An instance of the User class created during initialization.
Methods:
__init__(self):

Initializes the fitness tracker by creating a User instance using the initialize_user() method.
initialize_user(self):

Prompts the user to input their name, age, and maximum number of exercises. Creates and returns a User object.
start_tracking(self):

Displays a menu of options in a loop:
Add steps.
View user stats.
Add exercises.
Exit the program.
Executes the corresponding action based on the user’s choice. Handles invalid inputs gracefully.
add_steps(self):

Prompts the user to input the number of steps and adds them to the user's total.
view_stats(self):

Prints the user’s details (steps, distance, and exercises) using the __str__ method of the User class.
add_exercise(self):

Prompts the user to input multiple exercises (up to the max_exercises limit). Adds each exercise to the user's list.
3. Main Program Execution
if __name__ == "__main__"::
This is the entry point of the program. It ensures that the script runs only when executed directly, not when imported as a module.
Creates a FitnessTracker instance and starts the fitness tracking process using the start_tracking() method.
How It Works
When the program runs:

The user is prompted to enter their name, age, and the maximum number of exercises they want to store.
A User object is created with this information.
The menu (start_tracking) provides options:

Add Steps: Prompts the user to enter a step count. Updates the total steps and calculates the distance.
View Stats: Displays the user’s name, age, total steps, calculated distance, and list of exercises.
Add Exercise: Prompts the user to input exercises (one by one, up to the maximum limit). Adds them to the list.
Exit: Ends the program.
The program runs in a loop until the user selects "Exit."

Key Features
Menu-Driven:

Simple user interface with clear options.
Dynamic Input Handling:

Accepts user input for steps and exercises dynamically.
Error Handling:

Prevents invalid inputs (e.g., entering a string instead of a number).
Ensures exercises don’t exceed the user-defined limit.
Real-Time Updates:

Calculates distance automatically when steps are added.
This code is a beginner-friendly example of object-oriented programming in Python.
